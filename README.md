# reamp

So I'm looking for a job and this is my little demo app. This is just a simple audio player. Just open the [demo](https://petrovalexander.ru/reamp-demo-project) and add some tracks by either dragging them onto player window or using the add button.

And if this is not enough, I'll be glad to do a test task. Contact me on telegram: [@alexander3um](https://t.me/alexander3um).
